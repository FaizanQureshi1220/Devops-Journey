   - Built a simple CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions or Jenkins to automate builds and deployments.  

2. **Dockerized Todo Application**  
   - Containerized a MERN stack-based Todo app using Docker.

3. **Kubernetes Deployment**  
   - Deployed a multi-container application using Kubernetes.  

4. **AWS Terraform Setup**  
   - Used Terraform to provision AWS EC2 instances and S3 buckets.  

5. **Monitoring & Logging**  
   - Implemented Prometheus and Grafana for real-time monitoring of a containerized app.
